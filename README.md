- 👋 Hello, I’m Kevin Kim, a senior studying Neuroscience and Computer Science at Emory University. I'm currently interested in pursuing graduate studies in Computer Science to explore neural networks and transformer model design as an extension of pushing the boundaries of what I have learned about the brain when I studied neuroscience to work on continual learning models and affective computing systems.
- I’m interested in MLE, SWE, and Data Engineering roles that are more research oriented.
- I’m currently learning VLM, reinforcement learning models (q-learning models), and 2D sprite animation using Pixi.JS.
- I’m looking to collaborate on any projects especially ML related ones.
